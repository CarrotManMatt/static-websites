                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            These are the three words I strive to live by.
                            I think it's a simple way for us all to act
                            to the benefit of others.
                            <br/><br/>
                            • Communicate -
                            Talking clearly to others is imperative for understanding
                            and will quickly solve many issues.
                            Try to truly listen to others rather than just talking at them!
                            <br/><br/>
                            • Contemplate -
                            Always think about yourself,
                            how you are acting and the situation you are in.
                            It's certainly a bit "meta",
                            but I think self-awareness
                            is the key to ensuring we all act sensibly and kindly
                            <br/><br/>
                            • Appreciate -
                            I know it's rather vague, but it involves many things.
                            Try to understand the additional "baggage" others may be carrying,
                            always assume the best in people,
                            show explicit kindness & care to everyone

                            between focusing on the details and seeing the bigger picture.
                            I always strive for perfection in my work
                            (even with the understanding that it can never be met),
                            and hope that my interactions with others help them to also
                            reach completion to a high standard

                            You can probably tell that there's a theme between them all;

                                and their audience is often palpable.
                                Aiding in that process (whether it be in the wings,
                                at the lighting desk or on the sound board)
                                is always a rewarding experience

                                Both presenting and editing videos are useful skills
                                for me to take into the workplace,
                                even if my infrequent dabbling with it
                                is for smaller passion projects.
                                It's great fun to see a simple idea
                                turn into a piece of quality content,
                                especially when shared with others after completion

                                My home country is something I am both proud of and in awe of.
                                I love to explore all it has to offer
                                from the Bustling London Underground;
                                to the smallest of picturesque villages,
                                there's nowhere like here on earth.
                                I'm constantly surprised by the people,
                                culture & architecture that can easily be found
                                not too far away

                                I have a passion for exploring complex maths & physics
                                at a level of detail that few do.
                                I admit, I fell in love with the logical deduction
                                and problem-solving involved.
                                Mixed with my constant intake of educational YouTube content,
                                I don't think I'll ever want to stop my journey of discovery
                                into the building blocks of our world
